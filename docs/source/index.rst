Welcome to muda's documentation.
================================

Davi Raubach's Abjad Library.

Muda consists of some resources to easily build scores, write and transform music notation with Abjad and LilyPond. 
It carries a particular conception of music, its materials, and some processes I am interested in. It is flexible, though.

This example shows how it works: :ref:`example`.

It requires Python 3.6+ and some libraries.
abjad 3.3
abjadext.rmakers
iracema 0.1.7
matplotlib 3.3.4
