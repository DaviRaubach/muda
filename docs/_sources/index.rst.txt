Davi Raubach's Abjad Library.

Muda consists of some resources to easily build scores, write and transform music notation with Abjad and LilyPond. 
It carries personal musical conceptualizations regarding materials and some processes I am interested in. It is flexible, though.

It requires Python 3.10+ and some libraries.
abjad 3.6
abjadext.rmakers
